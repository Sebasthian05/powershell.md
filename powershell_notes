GetEvery command has verb and noun in syntax
Verbs -> get, set, remove
Nouns ->

Help Powershell commands 
get-command
get-verb
get-command -verb get
get-command -noun service
get-service
Powershell is not case-sensitive

cls to clear string

get-Eventlog -LogName Security -ComputerName

if filtering for word with a space in it you have to use "" 

you can use windows commands for powershell but cannot run powershell commands on windows
check alias for other commands 

key F5 runs entire line and F8 runs line section

Get-Help Get-Process ### shows how to write a cmdlet and what it does ### add -Full to get everything 
System.string = string
update-help -Force -ErrorAction silentlycontinue (runs through ErrorAction and silently continues)

get-help *log* looks for all commands with logs in them 
get-help -Examples get-process
get_help about_* shows all help files of cmdlets to get more information on what they do 
get-help get-process


Mandatory vs. Optional
if a command is optional it means you DO NOT have to put it in the syntax of the powershell lines, you can tell if a parameter is optional if you see square brackets around them []
if you don't mention the option it will default to what is in the get-help syntax by order 

get-childitem -path c:\windows -filter *.exe -recurse -name ### get-childitem looks in the directory of c:\windows and finds the name of exectables 

Alias commands 
$Alias:dir list directory in list format ###sets dir as a name to  
-$Alias:ls list directories in list format, is the same as dir
get-alias -Definition get-childitem ###shows all current alias you've made
set-Alias edit notepad.exe ###set-Alias formats by <name> <command>
get-alias -name edit ###sets the alias
remove-item alias:edit ### how to remove an alias

properties: information of the object 
methods: what can the object do

get-host ### gets version of powershell 

Alias are not persistent throughout shells (if you close your session you could not use it on a new one)

(Get-Process).ProcessName ### (Get-Process <processname>).prosessname()

get-process | get-member
where you can pull out properties and methods 
 
get-service | format-table Name, Status ### gets services andd formats it by name and status 

Prorperties can be formatted by the format command EX: format-table Name, Status

write-host doesn't put its output on the pipeline 
write-output puts it output in a pipeline

function
{
write-host "1"
write-host "8"
write-host "4"
write-host "6"
}

Function
{
write-output "1"
write-output "8"
write-output "4"
write-output "6"
}

Get-Variable
$HOME

in powershell you need the dollar sign in order to create variable
$a = 10
you can check if the variable is good by:

get-variable a 
a      10

or 

get-childitem variable:a

to test if variable is there Test-Path variable:a ### test path give confirmation if a variable is assigned or not 
True 

single quotes will put the literal string of the words in them write-host 'hello $var' prints hello var
double wuotes will account for variables in string

to set a list of numbers do 
$var = Get-Random -minimum 1 -maximum #


Arrays 
Arrays are listed by index
(get-process)-getType()
$proc = Get-Process
to find how much is in an object .count or .length
how to test for an array $<Array> -is [array]
how to test for other items [int],[string]
$array = 1..25 creates a list from 1 to 25 incrementing by one all the way up to 25
$array2 = "Hello", "world", $, 10, (get-type)
($array2[3]).GetType() shows what type the index specified is 

$array[$array.count-1] last count
(-4..10)[4]
>> 0
$array[4,0,1,2]
5
1
2
3

how to get help from arrays
get-help *array*
or
get-help about_array

jaggaed array is a nested array, an array within a array
$jagedarray = "joe", "jim", "jan" (1, ('apple', 'pear') 3), "jay" ### anytihng with parantheses is an array
$a = 1,2,3
$a += @(4,5,6)  ### means array, += means appending to array
$a += , @(7,8,9) ### the comma adds a nested array in the array mentioned 
you can specify how many strings you went in an array with *
EX 'BOOM' * 5 will print BOOM five times in an array

$targetingArray = @(
(35.73 , 51.33, "Terhran"),
(39.90, 116.40, "Bejing"),
(39.07, 125.81, "Pyongyang"),
(33.51, 36.27, "Damascus")
)

for each ($line in $targetingArray) {if ($line[-1] -eq "Bejing'){ write-output $line } ]

how to write a script block
$myblock = { get-services | format-table name, service }
& $myblock

prints services in table format with only name and service

$a = 1 
$c = {1 + 1}
$a += &$c

$a = 3

Sort
get-childitem | sort-object ### sorts list in alphabetical order
get-childitem | sort-object -descending ### sorts in descending order
get-childitem | sort-object -property length -descending ###sorts object by length from highest to low
sort is short for sort-object
-property is just file size 


Get-Service | Group-Object status ###groups based off status running/stopped
Get-ChildItem | Group-Object ${_.length -lt -1kb} ###it is a pipeline variable, whatever is being passed through the pipeline (in this case the output of childitem and getting the length of files less than 1Kb)
1, 3, 5, 8, 2, 10 | Sort-Object ###sorts by numerical order

like and match
-Like can use wildcards **
-match is more for regex (pattern matching)
-equal cannot use wildcards **

Add Member ScriptMethod adds methods to the property


foreach ($line in $targetingArray){
    if ($line[-1] -eq 'Bejing'){ 
        write-output $line 
    } 
}


$myblock = { get-services | format-table name, service }


$a = 1 
$c = {1 + 1}
$a += &$c

Get-Service | Group-Object status ###groups based off status running/stopped
Get-ChildItem | Group-Object ${_.length -lt -1kb} ###it is a pipeline variable, whatever is being passed through the pipeline (in this case the output of childitem and getting the length of files less than 1Kb)
1, 3, 5, 8, 2, 10 | Sort-Object ###sorts by numerical order 
'1', '3', "5", '8', "2", '10' | Sort-Object ###sorts by numerical order ???

1..10 | Sort-Object -Property { Get-Random } ###creates a list 1-10 and sorts randomly 
Get-Process | Select-Object -First 10 ###grabs first 10 process
Get-Process | Format-Table name, id
Get-Process | Select-Object name, id 
Get-Process | Get-Member ### shows options for commands 
get-Process | Select-Object name, id, Description ###runs commands from the get-member object
Get-Process | Select-Object -ExpandProperty name ### Expands only the name
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq 'running'} ### shows object 

###you can create transcripts and .ps1 files from powershell

Get-ChildItem *.txt | where-object {$_.Length -lt 100} ###
Get-ChildItem *.dll | where-object {$_.Length -gt 100} ###
Get-Process | where {$.name -like "*powershell*"} | Format-Table name, Description ###gives us a process where the name is like powershell
Get-Process | where {$.name -eq "idle"} | Format-Table name, Description ###finds a process where the name matches idle equally
1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3 | sort-object | Get-Unique ###sorts from least to greatest and grabs unique only variables """NOTE THAT YOU HAVE TO SORT BEFORE YOU GET UNIQUE"""
Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object -Property length ### its Measuring how many items are in C:\Windows\system32
Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object -Property length -Average -Maximum -Minimum -sum ### its Measuring how many items are in C:\Windows\system32 by -Average
(Get-ChildItem).count###counts how many items are in the result 

'i bet you all cant wait to graduate' > test.txt
$before = Get-ChildItem
'4' > test.txt
$after = gci
Compare-Object $before $after -Property length, name ###compares the length before and after changing the test.txt

$MyTruck = New-Object object
###add a property to a member
Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name Color -Value Black -InputObject $MyTruck ### puts a noteproperty with the name color and the value black in $myTruck
Add-Member -me NoteProperty -in $MyTruck -na Make -va Ford ###short-handed version that does the same above
$MyTruck | Add-Member NoteProperty -Name Model -Value F150 ### adds property through pipeline
Add-Member -MemberType ScriptMethod -in $MyTruck -na Drive -va { "going for a roadtrip" } ### how to add a method to an object
$MyTruck | Add-Member scriptMethod -name Park -Value { "finding a spot" } ###same as above but with pipe
$MyTruck | Add-Member scriptMethod stop { "coming to a stop" } ### same as above but no commands to specify name and value
